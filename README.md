# bbn_current_condition_ms
Repository contains supporting files for manuscript using Bayesian belief networks to assess current condition of freshwater fishes petitioned for listing under Endangered Species Act

Description of files:
piebaldmadtom_inputs_cr.neta: Netica file containing Bayesian belief network that replicates results in Dunn and Schumann et al. (in review).

Netica is a proprietary software that may not be available to manuscript readers, so we developed supplemental R code that replicates Netica's Bayesian belief network:

bbn_inputs_pmt_cr.xlsx: Excel sheet containing model inputs imported into R by script. Individual sheets contain default prior probabilities, observed values for Piebald Madtom that inform prior probabilities, and conditional probability tables within interior child nodes of Bayesian belief network.

bbn_piebaldmadtom_cr.R: R script that replicates Bayesian Belief network performed in piebaldmadtom_inputs_cr.neta. Code users need to change the local directory to import data inputs.

piebaldmadtom_results.xlsx: an output Excel file generated by bbn_piebaldmadtom_cr.R
